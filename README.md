## A MIDI controller keyboard interface - built in Rust! :)

I have a Nektar Impact LX88+ MIDI controller.
I want a way to treat it like a digital keyboard, like a Yamaha or Casio.
  - No, that is NOT what MIDI controller/keyboards are made for.
    - Yes, I am using it like that. I am having *plenty* of fun.
There are DAWs - but I don't need one, and don't know off the top of my head as to how to set one up.
  - Yes, Garageband is the correct application here.
    - No, I do not care.

**Yes, this is completely just an excuse to use Rust to do something fun ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€**

oooh, it's like we're crab raving!
